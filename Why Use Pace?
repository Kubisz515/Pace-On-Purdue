# Why Use Pace?

West Lafayette.in.gov’s website states, “whether it be for personal health, environmental consciousness or financial benefits; people are riding bikes everywhere. The city of West Lafayette recognizes that trend and has not only tried to give these road users what they deserve but has pushed the envelope in regards to bicycling infrastructure. With over 30 miles of paved trails for walking, running and biking that span the city, residents are provided with viable alternatives to driving their car to work.” 

Narrowing in this scope, Purdue University is continually making steps not only for more bicycle accessibility and usability, but transportation in general. This means Pace has support from the city of West Lafayette. 

You should use Pace if you're an undergraduate student, a graduate student, or a professor/teacher on Purdue University’s campus that needs a reliable transportation method. 

Pace is especially for you if:

* You prefer using a bicycle as your mode of transportation.
* You do not own your own bike, longboard/skateboard, scooter, etc. 

Pace is available to you if:

* You have a smartphone of some kind and are able to download Pace’s app on iOS or Android. 
* You are able to afford the service’s fees and charges per use, or the monthly plans available for you to choose from.
