# What is Pace?

Pace is a dockless bike sharing service Purdue has outsourced for people on campus. 


# Why Use Pace?

West Lafayette.in.gov’s website states, “whether it be for personal health, environmental consciousness or financial benefits; people are riding bikes everywhere. The city of West Lafayette recognizes that trend and has not only tried to give these road users what they deserve but has pushed the envelope in regards to bicycling infrastructure. With over 30 miles of paved trails for walking, running and biking that span the city, residents are provided with viable alternatives to driving their car to work.” 

Narrowing in this scope, Purdue University is continually making steps not only for more bicycle accessibility and usability, but transportation in general. This means Pace has support from the city of West Lafayette. 

You should use Pace if you're an undergraduate student, a graduate student, or a professor/teacher on Purdue University’s campus that needs a reliable transportation method. 

Pace is especially for you if:
You prefer using a bicycle as your mode of transportation.
You do not own your own bike, longboard/skateboard, scooter, etc. 

Pace is available to you if:
You have a smartphone of some kind and are able to download Pace’s app on iOS or Android. 
You are able to afford the service’s fees and charges per use, or the monthly plans available for you to choose from. 

# Pace's Prices

Pace tries to be affordable, or at least, relatively affordable to most people. Undergraduate/graduate students, seniors, veterans, and even people that use EBT have options available for them to use the service. However, you don’t have to fit any of these categories to use Pace. 
Pace vs. Buying a Bike
You might wonder why you would use Pace rather than buy your own bicycle, and you might also be wondering if that would save you money in the long run. 

This depends on how often you plan to use Pace in general. If you are:

A daily user: the annual plan would most likely be how you get your money’s worth for only $59.99. However, if you are using Pace very often it may be better for you to buy your own bike because it would be less money over the years.
Ex. You are an undergraduate student at Purdue (and will be for the next four years) and you want a bicycle to get around campus quickly. Four years of the annual plan would cost you $239.96. If you bought your own bicycle, depending on how expensive it is, having your own bike will cost you less. 
Occasional User: perhaps using their monthly payment method is better (see below), so you can cancel any time and you did not spend more than you needed to. 
Ex. You don't always use Pace, but do need it from time to time. You use it for a few months, but then realize you want to use another service, don’t have the money for it anymore, or have acquired your own personal mode of transportation. In this case, you could cancel your monthly plans from reoccurring and you’ve spent way less money than you would have with the annual plan. 

Pace has a few payment plans to choose from:

Unlimited 30-minute rides starting at $4.99/month: (only for the first 3 months) You can take unlimited rides up to 30 minutes for this monthly fee. After the promotional three months are over, the monthly cost is $9.99. 
Annual Plan: You can also sign up for an annual plan for $59.99. 
Student, senior, and military discount: If you are a student, senior, or a veteren you are able to receive a 50% discount on the monthly plan for only $4.99 a month. 

Pay with Cash: If you do not have a credit/debit card, Pace has partnered with PayPal Cash and PayNearMe so you can ride Pace with cash. 

EBT Discounts: If you have EBT, EBT members automatically qualify for unlimited 30-minute trips for just $4.99 a month.

# How to Use Pace

## In the App

The Pace app is available on Apple’s App Store and Google Play. When you open the Pace app after downloading, the app will then prompt you to put your first and last name, email, and number. Your number is needed in order to verify your account, and a code will be sent to your phone with a four digit pin to enter in the app. 

Afterwards, the app will ask you your preferred method to pay. However, this step can be skipped for later. Next, you will see three steps to help you use pace:

1. Find a Bike – The map will show bikes at Pace stations.
1. Choose Your Bike – Each bike has a number by the handlebars, match the number in the app.
1. Unlock & Ride – Select the bike you want to ride, the lock will open automatically and you remove the cable.

## While Using the Pace Bike

Make Quick Stops – If needed, you can make a quick stop by putting your Pace bike on a pace or public rack (Pace rack =blue pin, public rack = white pin).
End Your Ride – In order to end your ride, find a Pace or public rack, tap ‘end rental’ in the app, and slide down the orange tab. Secure the bike to the pace or public rack with the cable.

# Going the Distances

## Shorter Distances

Students that belong to these colleges have closer access to Pace’s docking stations: 

College of Agriculture
College of Education
College of Engineering
College of Exploratory Studies
College of Health & Human Sciences
College of Liberal Arts
College of Management
College of Pharmacy
College of Purdue Polytechnic Institute
College of Science
College of Veterinary Medicine

These colleges all have specific buildings undergraduate/graduate students, or professors/teachers will have to attend classes in. These specific buildings are closer to Pace docking stations than the longer distance locations (see “Longer Distances” below).
For these shorter distance locations, Pace is a viable mode of transportation. 

## Longer Distances

Some locations on Purdue’s campus are too far to walk and get to in a timely manner, and Pace may not be present in those areas either. For these longer distances, Pace is not a viable mode of transportation (besides Purdue University Airport), and is recommended that you use a different method. 

### Leaper X

Leaper X is an emerging service Purdue will be implemented during the Fall 2019 semester. This mode of transportation is a possible substitute for Pace when it is not present. 

Leaper X users from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., riders can travel from "one of approximately 50 central, on-campus locations to a selection of perimeter destinations and back again." This will include the following:

Purdue University Airport
Purdue Technology Center Aerospace
Zucrow Laboratories
Parking and Transportation Services
Surplus Store
East Airport Parking Lot

Leaper X will replace both the CityBus Black Loop and the Av Tech stop on the Gold Loop for the remainder of Fall 2019 semester in the coming weeks. Students that rely on the Gold Loop and the Black Loop for their transportation instead of Pace, or just in general, might need to download the new app and use the Leaper X service instead as Pace only has a docking station at the Purdue University Airport. 

Parking and Transportation Services: Purple Zone on Leaper X map.
Purdue Technology Center Aerospace: Yellow Zone on Leaper X map.
Purdue University Airport: Blue Zone on Leaper X map.
Surplus Store: Purple Zone on Leaper X map.
Zucrow Laboratories: Blue zone on Leaper X map.

## Other Bus Routes

If students do not have the money to pay for the Pace service, then the “Gold Loop” CityBus reaches all the way to the Purdue University Airport. The CityBus is free to any Purdue student with a Purdue I.D. The CityBus also has several routes in this area; Gold Loop, Silver Loop, Black Loop, Tower Acres, Ross Ade, and Outer Loop.

# Pace in the Weather

Pace does not offer much help when weather is an issue. According to BestPlaces.com, West Lafayette’s rainfall is around the nation’s average, and snowfall is nine inches below the nation’s average. In other words, expect the weather to have rain and snow in the months in which it’s supposed to and prepare accordingly.

Overall, Pace is not optimized for use in the rain or snow, and is best in the same conditions as a regular bicycle would be. For these weather conditions, it is suggested you dress accordingly (umbrella, rain jacket, winter coat, etc.) to the weather for the safest travelling. 

## Using Pace in the Rain

Pace is not meant to be the answer to rain or snow, however can still be an option to choose when deciding how fast you need to get to another location. The roads, sidewalks and bike paths can all become slippery and rubber tires on bicycles, even with good treads, is subject to slipping on these surfaces. When a student is considering what to choose, it may be safer for them to use the CityBus, or just walk with an umbrella/rain jacket.

## Using Pace in the Snow

Pace cannot combat the cold weather and snow any better than a regular bicycle would. Ice, black ice, lightly packed snow, sleet, or any other form of snow can still cause accidents if a student is not careful while riding over it. The CityBus is a great way for students to travel across campus if they want to escape the cold, stay warm, and do not mind to wait for it.
