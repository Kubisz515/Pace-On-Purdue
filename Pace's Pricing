# Pace's Prices

Pace tries to be affordable, or at least, relatively affordable to most people. Undergraduate/graduate students, seniors, veterans, and even people that use EBT have options available for them to use the service. However, you don’t have to fit any of these categories to use Pace. 

# Pace vs. Buying a Bike

You might wonder why you would use Pace rather than buy your own bicycle, and you might also be wondering if that would save you money in the long run. 

This depends on how often you plan to use Pace in general. If you are:

* A daily user: the annual plan would most likely be how you get your money’s worth for only $59.99. However, if you are using Pace very often it may be better for you to buy your own bike because it would be less money over the years.
  * Ex. You are an undergraduate student at Purdue (and will be for the next four years) and you want a bicycle to get around campus quickly. Four years of the annual plan would cost you $239.96. If you bought your own bicycle, depending on how expensive it is, having your own bike will cost you less. 
* Occasional User: perhaps using their monthly payment method is better (see below), so you can cancel any time and you did not spend more than you needed to. 
  * Ex. You don't always use Pace, but do need it from time to time. You use it for a few months, but then realize you want to use another service, don’t have the money for it anymore, or have acquired your own personal mode of transportation. In this case, you could cancel your monthly plans from reoccurring and you’ve spent way less money than you would have with the annual plan. 

Pace has a few payment plans to choose from:

* Unlimited 30-minute rides starting at $4.99/month: (only for the first 3 months) You can take unlimited rides up to 30 minutes for this monthly fee. After the promotional three months are over, the monthly cost is $9.99. 
Annual Plan: You can also sign up for an annual plan for $59.99. 
Student, senior, and military discount: If you are a student, senior, or a veteren you are able to receive a 50% discount on the monthly plan for only $4.99 a month. 
* Pay with Cash: If you do not have a credit/debit card, Pace has partnered with PayPal Cash and PayNearMe so you can ride Pace with cash. 
* EBT Discounts: If you have EBT, EBT members automatically qualify for unlimited 30-minute trips for just $4.99 a month.
