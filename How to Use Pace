How to Use Pace

In the App

The Pace app is available on Apple’s App Store and Google Play. When you open the Pace app after downloading, the app will then prompt you to put your first and last name, email, and number. Your number is needed in order to verify your account, and a code will be sent to your phone with a four digit pin to enter in the app. 
Afterwards, the app will ask you your preferred method to pay. However, this step can be skipped for later. Next, you will see three steps to help you use pace:

Find a Bike – The map will show bikes at Pace stations.
Choose Your Bike – Each bike has a number by the handlebars, match the number in the app.
Unlock & Ride – Select the bike you want to ride, the lock will open automatically and you remove the cable.

While Using the Pace Bike

Make Quick Stops – If needed, you can make a quick stop by putting your Pace bike on a pace or public rack (Pace rack =blue pin, public rack = white pin).
End Your Ride – In order to end your ride, find a Pace or public rack, tap ‘end rental’ in the app, and slide down the orange tab. Secure the bike to the pace or public rack with the cable.
