# Pace-On-Purdue
Hello world! 

The audience for this website is for undergraduate/graduate students, and professors/teachers that attend Purdue Univeristy to be aware of their transportation options on campus, more notably Pace. Other faculty, staff, seniors, veterans, and people of varying income (and use EBT) are considered as well. 

It is important to note that I am looking to see how viable Pace is as a mode of transportation given certain conditions like, weather, distance, financial issues, convenience, etc. and inform my audience what their best option is.
