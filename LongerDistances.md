Purdue University Airport

This specific location is far away from most of the buildings the majority of students have classes in, which makes transportation from here especially difficult for students that need a reliable ride. If students at the Purdue University Airport do not have their own car, bike, skateboard/longboard, Pace does have one station located there. 

Other Bus Routes

If students do not have the money to pay for the Pace service, then the “Gold Loop” CityBus reaches all the way to the Purdue University Airport. The CityBus is free to any Purdue student with a Purdue I.D. The CityBus also has several routes in this area; Gold Loop, Silver Loop, Black Loop, Tower Acres, Ross Ade, and Outer Loop.
