# Pace in the Weather

Pace does not offer much help when weather is an issue. According to BestPlaces.com, West Lafayette’s rainfall is around the nation’s average, and snowfall is nine inches below the nation’s average. In other words, expect the weather to have rain and snow in the months in which it’s supposed to and prepare accordingly.

Overall, Pace is not optimized for use in the rain or snow, and is best in the same conditions as a regular bicycle would be. For these weather conditions, it is suggested you dress accordingly (umbrella, rain jacket, winter coat, etc.) to the weather for the safest travelling. 

## Using Pace in the Rain

Pace is not meant to be the answer to rain or snow, however can still be an option to choose when deciding how fast you need to get to another location. The roads, sidewalks and bike paths can all become slippery and rubber tires on bicycles, even with good treads, is subject to slipping on these surfaces. When a student is considering what to choose, it may be safer for them to use the CityBus, or just walk with an umbrella/rain jacket.

## Using Pace in the Snow

Pace cannot combat the cold weather and snow any better than a regular bicycle would. Ice, black ice, lightly packed snow, sleet, or any other form of snow can still cause accidents if a student is not careful while riding over it. The CityBus is a great way for students to travel across campus if they want to escape the cold, stay warm, and do not mind to wait for it.
